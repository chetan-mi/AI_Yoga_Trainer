# Profile and Account Settings Routes Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `/profile` Route
**Problem:** Dashboard had a link to `/profile` but the route didn't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Solution:** Added the missing route in `app.py`:
```python
@app.route('/profile')
@login_required
def profile():
    """User profile page"""
    return render_template('profile.html', user=current_user)
```

### 2. Missing Forgot Password Link
**Problem:** Login page didn't have a forgot password option.

**Solution:** 
- Added forgot password link in `login.html`
- Added CSS styling for the link
- Added a route that redirects to account settings

### 3. Missing Account Deletion API
**Problem:** Account settings page referenced `/api/user/account` DELETE endpoint that didn't exist.

**Solution:** Added the API endpoint to handle account deletion:
```python
@app.route('/api/user/account', methods=['DELETE'])
@login_required
def delete_account():
    # Deletes user activities, sessions, and account
```

### 4. Missing Import
**Problem:** `generate_password_hash` was used but not imported.

**Solution:** Added the import:
```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
```
